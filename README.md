# Custom Homebrew Versions

Sometimes I need some weird versions of software for projects I'm working on. This is where I put the homebrew formulae for this software.

Use at your own risk. MIT licence applies.

## How do I install these formulae?
`brew install lenary/versions/<formula>`

Or `brew tap lenary/versions` and then `brew install <formula>`.

Or install via URL (which will not receive updates):

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lenary/homebrew-versions/master/Formula/<formula>.rb
```

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
